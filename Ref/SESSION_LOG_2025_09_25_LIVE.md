### Task #1: Todo Page Checkbox UI and Task Removal
**Time**: Active session
**Objective**: Replace strikethrough UI with checkboxes and add task removal functionality

#### Changes Made to `/workspaces/ZQLC/app/todo/page.tsx`

**1. Enhanced Checkbox UI System**
- **Replaced status icons**:
  - Completed (C): `■` → `☑` (checked box)
  - Cancelled (X): `■` → `☒` (X'd box)
  - Active tasks: `□` → `☐` (empty checkbox)
- **Removed strikethrough styling**:
  - Completed tasks: `text-gray-400 line-through` → `text-green-600` (clean green)
  - Cancelled tasks: `text-red-400 line-through` → `text-red-400` (clean red)
- **Enhanced status indicators**:
  - Added `✓ completed` text for completed tasks
  - Added `✗ cancelled` text for cancelled tasks
  - Improved visual hierarchy with proper colors

**2. Added Task Removal Functionality**
- **New function**: `removeTaskFromCard(taskId: string)`
  - Removes task from `task_cards` table (unlinks from current card)
  - Preserves original task data in `tasks` table
  - Automatically reloads card tasks after removal
- **UI Implementation**:
  - Remove button (`×`) appears on hover using `group-hover:opacity-100`
  - Click event with `stopPropagation()` to prevent status toggle
  - Proper hover states with red color scheme
  - Responsive design with appropriate touch targets

**3. Improved User Interactions**
- **Separated click targets**:
  - Checkbox icon: Click to toggle status (with hover scale effect)
  - Task content: Click to toggle status
  - Remove button: Click to remove from card
- **Enhanced visual feedback**:
  - Hover effects on checkboxes with `scale-110` transform
  - Smooth transitions on all interactive elements
  - Group hover reveals remove button elegantly

#### Technical Implementation Details
- **Database Operation**: `DELETE FROM task_cards WHERE task_id = ? AND card_id = ?`
- **Data Preservation**: Tasks remain in system with full audit trail
- **Error Handling**: Try-catch with console logging for debugging
- **UI Responsiveness**: Mobile-friendly touch targets and hover states
- **Accessibility**: Proper button titles and visual hierarchy

#### User Experience Improvements
- **Cleaner completed tasks**: No more strikethrough, proper checkbox visualization
- **Quick task removal**: Hover and click × to remove unwanted tasks instantly
- **Visual clarity**: Clear distinction between completed, cancelled, and active states
- **Preserved functionality**: All existing status cycling functionality maintained
